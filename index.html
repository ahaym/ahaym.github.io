    <h2>Mark Hay</h2>
    <p>I'm Mark, a programmer living in the United States. My interests are in functional programming, machine learning, and mathematics. I write code primarily in Haskell.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>I'm currently the CTO of <a href='https://textql.com'>TextQL</a>, a startup building data analysis tools for non-technical users.</p>
    <p>I worked for Facebook from 2019-2022 on the Integrity Infrastructure team, contributing to the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/06/26/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/">Sigma</a> and <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2014/06/10/web/open-sourcing-haxl-a-library-for-haskell/">Haxl</a> projects.
    <p>I graduated from Williams College in June 2019. I was also on the rowing team. </p>
    <p>In the summer of 2018, I was an intern at <a href="http://tsurucapital.com/en/">Tsuru Capital</a>, an options market making firm in Tokyo, Japan.
    <p>I was born in South Carolina, and spent most of my youth in Decatur, Alabama, along with a few years in Spokane, Washington.</p>

    <h3>Misc.</h3>
    My hobbies are bodyweight fitness, cooking, and reading, particularly in Chinese (can read most anything by this point) and Japanese (mostly limited to shonen and light novels).
