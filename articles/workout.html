<h1 id="my-current-15-minute-a-day-bodyweight-workout-routine-intermediate">My current 15-minute a day bodyweight workout routine (intermediate)</h1>
<p>2020-10-25</p>
<p>I feel I’ve stumbled across a goldmine in my current intermediate BW routine. It is so incredibly short that I can slip it in during lunch hour, yet also very challenging and effective. Here it is:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="workout-a-push">Workout A (Push)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warm up (unweighted push ups)</li>
<li>Weighted Push ups, 10x10 EMOM</li>
<li>5 minutes accessory superset (normally band lat raises + face pulls)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workout-b-pull">Workout B (Pull)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warm up (negative)</li>
<li>Chin ups, 10x10 EMOM</li>
<li>5 minutes accessory superset (normally L-sit or front lever + band curls)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workout-c-conditioning-some-legs">Workout C (Conditioning, some legs)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warm up (jump rope)</li>
<li>50 burpees with jump, as fast as possible</li>
<li>accessory superset (normally band hamstring curls + band good mornings)</li>
<li>stretching</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I normally do A, B, C, rest, and then repeat it all over. Pretty simple, right?</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>My results have been solid since starting this in Late August, on par with my previous &gt;45min routine despite being more advanced in strength.</p>
<hr />
<p>5’11.5, 152lb</p>
<p>Max push ups (40lb vest, 2 count negative, narrow grip): <strong>27->32</strong></p>
<p>Max pull ups (unweighted, neutral grip, shoulder width): <strong>32->34</strong></p>
<p>One armed pull ups: Can’t even hold on to the bar -&gt; Half rep with each arm</p>
<p>50 burpees time: <strong>2:40->2:16</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="emom">EMOM</h2>
<p>EMOM means “every minute on the minute”. You start a timer, then immediately do a set. Then at 1:00 do another set, then at 2:00, and so on. I learned about this technique from Kane Sumabat’s instagram page, where he does multiple 10x5 EMOM sets as part of a full body routine. Here’s the post, but warning; <strong>the audio is ridiculously NSFW</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-IKPRA2VW/">post</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple great things about this scheme. It’s timeboxed. Not only are you certain the exercise will only take a certain amount of time, you can be sure that improved results week over week are genuinely improvements, and not just due to having more rest on a certain day. Strict intervals on a resetting timer kind of accomplish this as well, but they don’t penalize taking longer between reps. Since your work and rest are merged into the same time interval, you’re incentivized to move explosively, which improves both <a href="https://www.musculardevelopment.com/training/3312-explosive-lifting-for-muscle-hypertrophy-by-robbie-durand.html">strength and hypertrophy gains</a>, though you should be reasonable and not cheat and at least control the negative a little bit. The low rest is also great for conditioning/GPP.</p>
<h2 id="emom-progression">EMOM Progression</h2>
<p>There are multiple progression strategies that I’ve come up with.</p>
<h3 id="amrap-last-set">AMRAP Last Set</h3>
<p>The easiest way to add dynamic progression is to do as many reps as you can the last set. This number indicates how you’re progressing, with 15+ signaling I should probably add some of the other techniques below to make the overall workout harder. Drop sets/partial reps might work as well.</p>
<h3 id="weightresistance">Weight/Resistance</h3>
<p>Just add weight by wearing a weight vest or backpack. For push ups, you’ll want to add parallettes if you aren’t already using them in order to increase the range of motion, as the vest decreases it by sticking out from your chest. They’ll also protect your wrists. For push ups, a resistance band around the back can substitute or supplement straight weight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’ve already exhausted the weight avenue for the time being, as my weight vest is 40lb and I can already do 10x10 push ups with it, and my pull-up bar is door-mounted so I’d rather not have the vest on at all. I do still have a resistance band I can use for push ups in addition to the weight.</p>
<h3 id="more-reps">More Reps</h3>
<p>Add more reps to each set, add more sets, or do more work on the side. I’d rather not add more sets on top of 10x10, as the first 2-3 sets are already pretty easy, and adding more sets means increasing the amount of easy sets at the front. To add more reps per set I’d do it pyramiding, increasing the reps on the first 2 sets, then the next 2, and so on.</p>
<p>I’ll also do extra sets of 20 throughout the day after the main EMOM workout if I’m feeling good; I think this is a nice way to get some more weekly volume.</p>
<h3 id="griprom">Grip/ROM</h3>
<p>Grip width is currently my main progression method. For both exercises I’ve started with a wide grip and moved in as I’ve gotten stronger. Narrowing the grip increases the range of motion (up to shoulder width) and increases the load on weaker muscles like the biceps, triceps, and delts.</p>
<p>For push ups, raising your feet might also be a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="objections">Objections</h2>
<p>Here I address some potential issues you might have with the program. Note that I’m not an expert; if you think there’s something that could be done better, feel free to experiment and report your results!</p>
<h4 id="low-rest-isn’t-optimal">Low rest isn’t optimal</h4>
<p>No, it’s not. I find the time efficiency and conditioning gains of EMOM to outweigh a potential slight increase in gains. I’m also not an advanced trainee so I have room to make compromises like that. If you want to do 10 sets with 3 minutes rest, have at it.</p>
<h4 id="low-1rm-isn’t-optimal">Low %1rm isn’t optimal</h4>
<p>I don’t have access to a gym, sorry. Anyways, high reps done to near failure <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/">aren’t that much worse</a>, and elite powerlifters also utilize low-rest high-sets done explosively, it’s called <a href="https://www.westside-barbell.com/blogs/articles-2009/dynamic-method">the dynamic effort method</a>. For me, all sets past 3-4 feel quite challenging, and I nearly fail at sets 8-10 at my current ROMs. Even if you don’t count any of the previous sets, isn’t 14 effective sets a week plenty?</p>
<p>And again, I’m fine trading minor suboptimality for convenience, and it’s not like I’m not progressing.</p>
<h4 id="do-the-reddit-routine">Do the reddit routine</h4>
<p>It’s too long, and I’m not smart enough to keep track of such a large program.</p>
<h4 id="do-advanced-progressions-ie-plancheone-armed-push-up">Do advanced progressions (i.e. planche/one armed push up)</h4>
<p>I do, see the next section. I don’t want to focus on the progressions though as they’re primarily technique limited and not strength, and I care more about strength right now.</p>
<h4 id="law-of-accommodation">Law of Accommodation</h4>
<p>I don’t do this workout every time. I’ll swap for band/unilateral/tech work sometimes, as well as different rep schemes which I’ll put in a separate <a href="./reps.html">post</a>. Varying grip width might also help with this.</p>
<h4 id="won’t-narrowing-the-grip-de-emphasize-the-chestlats">Won’t narrowing the grip de-emphasize the chest/lats?</h4>
<p>Narrow grip <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7x0jqq/diamond_pushups_use_more_chest_than_wide_pushups/">hasn’t been shown</a> to demphasize the chest too much for push ups. I’m not aware of a similar result for pull ups, but I suspect it is similar, and even if not my lats are overdeveloped anyways. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9jp9rJ3Ss">Hannibal For King</a> also recommends narrow grip for better “sculpt”.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-do-emom-for-legs">Why not do EMOM for legs?</h4>
<p>I don’t really want to, as my legs have historically outpaced my upper body, and I want to work on conditioning (hence the burpees.) I think something like 10x15-20 EMOM weighted vest squats or jumps could be pretty good though.</p>
