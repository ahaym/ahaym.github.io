    <h2>Mark Hay</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Mark, a programmer living in the United States. My interests are in functional programming, programming languages, machine learning, and mathematics. I write primarily in Haskell.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>I graduated from Williams College in June 2019 with a degree in Computer Science. I was also a member of the men's rowing team. </p>
    <p>In the summer of 2018, I was an intern at <a href="http://tsurucapital.com/en/">Tsuru Capital</a> in Tokyo, Japan, where I worked on high-performance trading systems in Haskell.</p>
    <p>From 2017-2018, I was an exchange student in the <a href="https://exeter.williams.edu/">Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford</a>.</p>

    <h3>Misc.</h3>
    <p>My Chinese surname is 許, making my Chinese name 许马克/許馬克, though I also answer to 许自豪. The romanization "Hay" seems to come from an uncommon Hokkien pronunciation. In Japanese, I prefer 許マーク, where my surname is pronounced 「こ」.</p>
    <p>I have some level of proficiency in Mandarin (okay-ish), Japanese (elementary), and Hokkien (very elementary.)</p>
