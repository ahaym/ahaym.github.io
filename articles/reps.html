<h1 id="other-workouts-i-use">Other workouts I use</h1>
<p>2020-10-26</p>
<p>These are other workouts I use sometimes in substitute of my normal <a href="./workout.html">EMOM</a> routine.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-pyramid-rest-pause">Reverse-pyramid rest-pause</h2>
<p>This is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03p5JZ4ViIA">DC training</a>. Do as many reps as possible for a two-count negative. Take 15 deep breaths, AMRAP again. Repeat once more, then you’re done. I’ll normally do two sets of these. For push ups, 40lb and 20lb. For pull ups, 40lb and 0lb (I do the weighted set in the park to not stress my door bar, though that’s closed  right  now which is why I don’t have recent weighted max numbers). Afterwards, I’ll do a deep stretch using a band or pull up bar. Theoretically you aren’t supposed to be able to do more than one of these in a day, but I’m probably not at the levels of muscle activation of Dusty Hanshaw.</p>
<p>This scheme is also how I get my max rep numbers as described in the other post.</p>
<p>This was the core of my previous routine, and it was brutal. Now I do these on weekends when I’m feeling good and have plenty of time. I’ll also do the EMOM workouts fasted, which I wouldn’t dare with this.</p>
<h2 id="supersets">Supersets</h2>
<p>4-5x10 weighted pull ups supersetted with 14 push ups, with slow negatives. After, a giant set of lat raises, curls, and core. I do this when I’m at my parents’ house and have good access to a pull up bar that can handle weight as a MWF full body workout to give myself more family time.</p>
<h2 id="straight-sets">Straight sets</h2>
<p>I’ll normally do the typical 3x3-12 for more technical movements, such as one-armed push ups. I also use straight sets when I’m feeling tired and want an easy workout, something like 4x20 wide grip push ups (no weight), 4x10 pull ups and some light band work.</p>
<h2 id="n-down">N Down</h2>
<p>For this scheme, you pick a target number N and an exercise, say push ups, and then do that number, and then N-1, N-2, all the way down to zero. Supposedly this is a pretty popular technique among prisoners. I learned about this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVk25-M8XAw">this legendary video</a> from Ilyas Neal. I tried this for a week for push ups and pull ups and thought it was a bit boring, but obviously Ilyas proves it can be effective. I’ll try 30 down squats every now and then whenever I want some extra leg volume.</p>
<p>That’s it, let me know if you have any better suggestions.</p>
