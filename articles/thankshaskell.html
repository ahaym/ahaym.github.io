  <p><em>Give those same tools, though, to a master woodcarver, someone who has devoted their lifetime to the art. You already see where I am headed. He could turn it into a flower, a bird, the image of a friend lost long before. He could carve intricate patterns into it, portray virtually anything he wished, limited only by his own creativity and inclination. Even though we have the same tools and starting point, the carver here would be much more free than I. Where I can only create something crude and imprecise regardless of the beauty in my thoughts or heart, he can trace his soul into every piece of wood he chooses to lift.”</em></p>

<p>I wrote this piece about Haskell, as a sort of thank-you letter to it and everyone I’ve encountered as a result of opening up <em>Real World Haskell</em> on a rainy day, but I hope you take away something even if Haskell doesn’t interest you. If there’s a niche technology or topic that you deeply enjoy, give it a shot! Don’t worry about straying slightly from the beaten path of Javascript or whatever the equivalent is in your own field.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1312/">Haskell does have side effects!</a></p>
<p>Learning the Haskell programming language has been, without a doubt, the best single decision I have made in the past few years. Haskell and the opportunities and people I’ve met through it have had an incredible positive effect on many aspects of my life, whether that be intellectually, economically, or socially.</p>
<p>One paragraph in, and I imagine that you already think I’m some sort of insane FP-Category Theory zealot. To be clear, I don’t think that this is all due to Haskell specifically, so I wouldn’t recommend learning Haskell as a general self-improvement technique; much of it can be attributed to the overall benefits of becoming interested and skilled in a particular thing, and more still can be attributed to the pure luck of running into the right people and opportunities at the right time. On the other hand, I do think there’s something unique about Haskell and its community that makes it uniquely suited to creating such an incredible experience and would, in fact, recommend learning a bit of Haskell to any practicing programmer interested in improving their craft.</p>
<p>In early 2018 I was halfway through my third year of university, and searching for programming internships on the internet. I thought programming was pretty fun and had good career outcomes, so majoring in computer science and looking for a programming job was a natural fit. I came across a reddit post advertising an internship at <a href="https://www.tsurucapital.com">Tsuru Capital</a> in Tokyo, with an associated Haskell coding challenge. I had a bit of knowledge of functional Scala from a programming languages class, so why not apply? So, I spent a few hours a day for a week going through <em>Real World Haskell</em> and doing its associated exercises before finally tackling the coding challenge. The challenge was quite enjoyable, covering Haskell’s excellent capabilities in streaming and parsing. Lo and behold, I got the internship!</p>
<p>The internship experience was incredible and I might write a review of it some time. Entering the company, I honestly felt like a pretty poor programmer. I could put together a correct solution for boxed-in school assignments or coding interview problems, but the ability to reason about real programs across many files and dependencies was lacking. Tackling interesting production problems in binary parsers, options pricing, and reactive UI, as well as discussing programming practice with the very competent traders and programmers went a long way towards fixing this hole in my knowledge. Moreover, I simply had a ton of fun! I learned a bit of Japanese, ate delicious food, explored Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and Hakone, and spent a lot of money at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiket">Comiket</a>.</p>
<p>In large part due to the internship, I was able to land my current job working on the abuse classification engine <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/">Sigma</a>, written in Haskell. The pay is pretty good, the work interesting, and my previous experience in systems Haskell and stats/ML lets me make some solid contributions to the codebase.</p>
<p>As you can see, learning Haskell got me a cool internship that got me a cool job. If this is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12056169">avoiding success at all costs</a>, Haskell is doing a pretty bad job. But there’s more! It would be a bit of a letdown to this article’s title if the extent of Haskell’s influence was netting me work. After all, the biggest hurdle to getting a big tech company job is the whiteboard interview, and I use C++ for those.</p>
<h2 id="the-language">The Language</h2>
<p>Haskell gave me the tools to think deeply about programming and mathematics. Haskell’s type system and data model, particularly Algebraic Data Types, lay bare the strucuture of data as unions, intersections and fixed points. I find this much clearer than say, inheritance of abstract base classes. Haskell’s use of Monads similarly teaches one to be wary of effect-like computations, yet also wield them with power and generality (see Control.Monad.) Even when using C++ or Python I find myself thinking of state, asynchronicity, and propagated environments in terms of effect systems.</p>
<p>Learning all of this stuff was hard. Anyone that says they expended no effort grasping a set of abstractions orthogonal to those used in nearly every other widely-used language is either lying or a super-genius. But the value I gained from this effort is immense. One, the abstraction load of learning Haskell is so high that going to any other language afterwards felt like a joke (except template-heavy C++, but even there I feel it helped a bit.) More importantly, the act of thinking in types and effects forms an elegant framework from which I could much more easily understand a wide variety of problems. I’ve learned much about parsers, streaming, networks, systems, and numeric/probabilistic programming simply from reading relevant Haskell libraries and paying close attention to the type signatures, even if my ultimate use for the knowledge was outside of Haskell. I recently went through Sussman and Wisdom’s excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Classical_Mechanics"><em>Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</em></a> and Abishek Thakur’s less excellent but still solid <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Approaching-Almost-Machine-Learning-Problem-ebook/dp/B089P13QHT"><em>Approaching Any Machine Learning Problem</em></a>. Whenever I had trouble with something, I found that writing out type signatures for i.e. the Euler-Lagrange equation went a long way in resolving it. Moreover, the general feeling that “I learned how RankNTypes work, I should be able to figure this out” helped me push past any roadblocks.</p>
<p>It’s hard to quantify how valuable the aforementioned motivation and ability to learn new things has had on my life; while I may not ever use classical mechanics or abstract algebra in a work context, learning these topics have revealed to me fundamental beauty in the world and a sense that things are discovered (and not invented) that provides value beyond any cool programming job. That being said, others have similarly come across experiences that serve as valuable foundation for their later learning, i.e. Chemistry, Meditation, or <em>The Iliad</em>. Haskell is in no way the only or best route toward “learning how to learn”, merely the first leg of the route I’m personally taking.</p>
<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>
<p>The people I’ve had the opportunity of speaking with as a result of working in Haskell have also had strong positive effects on my life. The first person involved in the Haskell community I spoke with was <a href="https://nh2.me/">Niklas Hambüchen</a> when shortly after recieving the Tsuru offer I cold-emailed him for advice about whether or not I should accept. He was incredibly helpful, explaining his experience in Tsuru and the larger Haskell community. I was further struck with how enthusiastic he seemed about functional programming and technology in general. My experience interacting with other Haskell programmers and enthusiasts have largely been the same. In between the end of the school year and the start of my internship, I went to <a href="https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2020/">Zurihac</a>, and had a great time talking about Haskell with anyone who would listen. At Tsuru, I found all of the traders and developers there to be not only extremely strong programmers, but also people interested in programming and ready to help me whenever I had trouble. Likewise, I find my current coworkers involved in the company’s Haskell deployment, some of them quite prominent, to be similarly competent, enthusiastic, and helpful. I’m not particularly famous in the community, and don’t frequently contribute to OSS; unless you’ve worked with me directly you probably don’t know who I am, yet my experience remains overwhelmingly pleasant.</p>
<p>As far as technologies/langs go, I think that Haskell is especially well-suited to creating a uniformly competent and motivated community, far over trendier techs such as React, AI, and Blockchain. Its reputation as a theoretician’s language with little adoption and an unforgiving learning curve means that very few people enter solely for career stability or prestige. As a result, most people I encounter who write Haskell do so because they enjoy writing it, not because of trendiness or monetary gain; in other words, it’s not <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub</a>. Being a niche language isn’t all rosy though, and I’ve heard of numerous turf wars and petty squabbles throughout the community, though I don’t think I’ve been in any of them directly. Maybe it’s because I stay on /r/haskell and workplace/real life discussion and keep off HN, twitter, mailing lists, and IRC. I would have no trouble believing anyone who said they had a negative community experience through Haskell, I simply note that most all of the my encounters have been nothing but positive, and that has had a positive impact on my life.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before cracking open <em>Real World Haskell</em> two and a half years ago, I was a mediocre computer science student who enjoyed programming a little, but much preferred scrolling through reddit. I don’t think Haskell can solve my reddit problem, but what it has given me is a comfortable living, a deeper appreciation for computer science, and a group of peers I genuinely enjoy being around.
